## üõ† Installation & Setup

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NovaTalk.git
   cd NovaTalk

2. **Install the Required Libraries**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  #For Fine tuning the model

                                 **OR**

   ```bash
   pip install transformers torch  #For only model inference

###Fine tuning the Model
1. **Run the main.py file**
   ```bash
   python main.py   #REMEMBER ... This step may take long time to execute as the model is fine tuning from the scratch.

###To interact with the fine tuned model
1. **Run the Nova-talk-askme.py file**
   ```bash
   python nova_talk_askme.py
